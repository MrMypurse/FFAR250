          <p>Janet Sun. <i>Imaging Van Gogh</i>. Photograph. 2020 Montreal, Canada.</p>
          <p>The evolution of technologies has changed the way we view art. The digitalization of artworks can be seen a revolution of fine arts. As a computation art student and someone who is passionate about the technology industry, I feel like I
            have a special connection to the topic of “digital”. Personally, I am fascinated by the revolution of digitalization in the past 50 years. We are moving in an incredible speed towards global digitalization of information, including
            artworks. However, I think that there are both positive and negative sides of digitalization when it comes to creating and criticizing artworks in the 21st century. Digital devices are slowly shifting not only the way we make art, but
            also the way we view art. </p>
          <p>Conservative artists who supports the traditional way of making art, especially when it comes to crafting, argue that the new digital way of creating art is “cheating”. Digital devices bring ease, save time and labor, but they are also
            taking away a crucial element: the physical presence of art within the space and the time. In other words, the artwork’s aura. As in my personal experience, I would disagree with such argument. I think that painting with a canvas and a
            brush is completely different from painting on a tablet. Both need incredible skills. Digitalization does offer wider selection of tools and faster access, but it does not make painting easier.</p>

        <p>This is my favorite comfort food of all time: 4 ingredients egg fried rice by my grandmother. </p>
        <p>I grew up in my grandparent's house as a child, and my grandmother makes the best family recipes. She will make this dish for me whenever I’m hungry, because it is so easy to make and yet so delicious. Every time I try to recreate this
          dish, it never tastes as good and when she makes it. The key is to use duck eggs and cook it on a gas stove with a wok. All though we live in different countries now, her dishes will always hold a special place in my heart, and it will
          always make me feel like I’m home.</p>

        <p>Artist/Maker: Unknown/Mass produced</p>
        <p>Material and techniques: metal, enamel (finish)</p>
        <p>The metal mug is a drinking mug made of metal and with white enamel finish. During the World Wars era, these mugs, or any type of dishes that are made with similar materials, are used for everything because of their durability and
          sturdiness in military campaigns. The mug is usually included in the mess kit, which is a cookware collection for camping and backpacking. </p>
        <p>In Chinese culture, these mugs can still be found in the kitchen today, especially in older people’s home. Their practicality and their low price are the main reason of their popularity. Today, these mugs are brought back to furniture and
          kitchenware stores in Western culture. People purchase them for their minimalistic design and the retro aesthetic. They are also popular in backpacking and camping communities, because they are solid and light to carry.
          The mug marks a significant period of wars and survival in human history. It also shows the spirit of working-class people during that time.

        <p>Janet Sun. <i>Glitched Sadness</i>. Photo manipulation.</p>
        <p>My piece of gif is called “Glitched Sadness”. It features early windows system designs, because I think that Windows 95 is such a classic when it comes to the topic of “post internet”. My inspiration came from “vaporwave”, a popular visual art style that started in the early 2010s. Vaporwave features neon colors, web design from early 90s and glitch art. I’ve always loved vaporwave aesthetic for its colors and its surrealism. I think that this part of the popular culture perfectly represents people our age, who grew up with the influence of early computer technologies and early electronic music.</p>

        <p>Banksy. <i>Children with Paradise Landscape</i>, 2005 Bethlehem, Palestine.</p>
        <p>“Children with Paradise Landscape” is an illustration of two children playing with bucket and shovels, and a “broken” section in the grey wall revealing a photorealistic image of a tropical beach with beach, blue sky, palm tree and the
          ocean. The street art is created by Banksy, painted on the wall in Palestine which separates it from Israel. </p>
        <p>The wall in Palestine is constructed by the government of Israel. The border caused the forceful displacement of over 750 000 Palestinian citizens and the destruction of over 500 towns and agricultural lands. Although that the Israelis
          government claim that the wall is built against terrorism, the Palestinians side believes that its purpose is racial segregation. The artwork emphasized on the toll that political conflict took on the innocents. </p>
